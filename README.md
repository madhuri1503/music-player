# music-player
A music player in Python is a software application that plays audio files such as MP3, WAV, or FLAC. It can be created using various Python libraries such as Pygame, Tkinter.  The basic features of a music player in Python include the ability to select song, play, stop.

STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION:


1. Import the tkinter and pygame modules which provide GUI components and audio playback functionality for Python.
 
2. Create a class called MusicPlayer that inherits from the Tk class which represents the main window of the application.

3. Define the __init__ method which initializes the music player window and its components:
   
   a) Call the __init__ method of the Tk class to initialize the main window.
   
   b) Set the title of the window to "Music Player".
   
   c) Set the geometry of the window to 300 pixels wide and 400 pixels tall.
   
   d) Set the window to not be resizable.
   
   e) Create a label widget called logo that displays an image.
   
   f) Use the grid method to position the logo at row 0 and column 0 of the window.
   
   g) Create a label widget called song_title that displays the title of the currently   selected song.
   
   h) Use the grid method to position the song title label at row 1 and column 0 of the window.
   
   i)Create a listbox widget called playlist that displays the list of available songs.
   
   j) Use the grid method to position the playlist at row 2 and column 0 of the window.
   
   k) Create a button widget called select_song_button that allows the user to select a song from their local file system.
   
   l) Use the grid method to position the select song button at row 3 and column 0 of the window.
   
   m) Create button widgets called play_button and stop_button that allow the user to play and stop the selected song respectively.
   
   n) Use the grid method to position the play and stop buttons at row 4 and columns 0 and 1 of the window.
   
   o) Define the functions select_song, play_song, and stop_song that handle the user's actions and interact with the pygame module to play audio.

4. Create a new instance of the MusicPlayer class and start the main event loop by calling the mainloop method of the main window.


This code creates a simple music player with a basic user interface that allows the user to select a song from their local file system and play it using the pygame module. 
It uses the tkinter module to create a window with label, listbox, and button widgets for displaying and controlling the music playback. The user can select a song from the playlist by clicking the select song button and browsing their local file system.
The selected song is displayed in the song title label and added to the playlist. The user can play or stop the selected song by clicking the play or stop buttons. The pygame module is used to load and play the selected song.
